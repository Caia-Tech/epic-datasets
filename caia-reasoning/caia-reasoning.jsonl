We need to determine the least common denominator, or LCD, of these two fractions.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the least common denominator.**  \nWe find the least common multiple, or LCM, of \\( 6 \\) and \\( 9 \\). The prime factorization of \\( 6 \\) is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\) and the prime factorization of \\( 9 \\) is \\( 3^2 \\). The LCM takes the highest power of each prime factor. Thus, the LCM is \\( 2^1 \\times 3^2 = 18 \\). Therefore, the least common denominator is \\( 18 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Rewrite each fraction with the least common denominator.**  \nWe need to express both \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) and \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\) with a denominator of \\( 18 \\).  \n\nTo convert \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) to have a denominator of \\( 18 \\), we multiply both the numerator and denominator by \\( 3 \\). Thus, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1 \\times 3}{6 \\times 3} = \\frac{3}{18}.\n\\]  \nNext, we convert \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\) to have a denominator of \\( 18 \\) by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by \\( 2 \\). Thus, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{2 \\times 2}{9 \\times 2} = \\frac{4}{18}.\n\\]  \n\n**Step 4: Add the two fractions.**  \nNow that we have both fractions with the same denominator, we can add them:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{18} + \\frac{4}{18} = \\frac{3 + 4}{18} = \\frac{7}{18}.\n\\]  \n\n**Step 5: Verify that the resulting fraction is in lowest terms.**  \nWe need to check if \\( \\frac{7}{18} \\) is in lowest terms. The numerator \\( 7 \\) is a prime number, and the denominator \\( 18 \\) has the prime factors \\( 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\). Since \\( 7 \\) does not share any common factors with \\( 2 \\) or \\( 3 \\), we conclude that \\( \\frac{7}{18} \\) is indeed in lowest terms.\n\n**Dead Ends and Alternative Approaches:**  \nWe considered checking for a common denominator by listing multiples, but this method would have been inefficient. Instead, finding the LCM provided a clear and systematic way to determine the least common denominator.\n\n**Self-Verification and Error Analysis:**  \nThroughout the process, we confirmed each step by performing calculations carefully, ensuring that each conversion and addition was correct. We did not encounter any errors, as each action logically followed from the previous one.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nWe find that \\( \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{7}{18} \\). This result is expressed as a single fraction in lowest terms, demonstrating our initial claim.

We write [a] for the congruence class of an integer a modulo n.  We must prove that addition on \u2124\u2099 is well-defined.  In particular, we show that if [a] = [a\u2032] and if [b] = [b\u2032], then [a] + [b] = [a\u2032] + [b\u2032].\n\n**Step 1: State the given congruences**  \nWe begin by translating the hypothesis into congruence notation.  Since [a] equals [a\u2032], we know that a \u2261 a\u2032 mod n.  Since [b] equals [b\u2032], we know that b \u2261 b\u2032 mod n.\n\nAction: We record the given equalities of classes as congruences.  \nReasoning: We will need explicit congruences to invoke the definition of divisibility by n.  \nResult: We have a \u2212 a\u2032 is divisible by n and b \u2212 b\u2032 is divisible by n.  \nCorrectness: The statement follows directly from the definition of equivalence classes in \u2124\u2099.\n\n**Step 2: Invoke the definition of congruence**  \nWe apply the definition of congruence modulo n.  Because a \u2261 a\u2032 mod n, there exists an integer k such that a \u2212 a\u2032 = k n.  Because b \u2261 b\u2032 mod n, there exists an integer \u2113 such that b \u2212 b\u2032 = \u2113 n.\n\nAction: We introduce integers k and \u2113 to express the two congruences.  \nReasoning: We require explicit integer multiples of n so that we can later add them.  \nResult: We obtain the equalities a \u2212 a\u2032 = k n and b \u2212 b\u2032 = \u2113 n for some k, \u2113 \u2208 \u2124.  \nCorrectness: This step is valid by the definition of \u201cdivisible by n.\u201d\n\n**Step 3: Add the two difference equations**  \nWe add the two equations that we have obtained.  Specifically, we add a \u2212 a\u2032 = k n and b \u2212 b\u2032 = \u2113 n to get  \n\u2003(a \u2212 a\u2032) + (b \u2212 b\u2032) = k n + \u2113 n.\n\nAction: We perform addition on both sides of the two equalities.  \nReasoning: We want to express the difference (a + b) \u2212 (a\u2032 + b\u2032) as a single multiple of n.  \nResult: We arrive at (a + b) \u2212 (a\u2032 + b\u2032) = (k + \u2113) n.  \nCorrectness: The step uses the distributive and associative properties of integer addition.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude divisibility of the combined difference**  \nWe observe that k + \u2113 is an integer because k and \u2113 are integers.  Therefore (a + b) \u2212 (a\u2032 + b\u2032) is divisible by n.  By definition of congruence modulo n, we conclude that a + b \u2261 a\u2032 + b\u2032 mod n.  Hence [a + b] = [a\u2032 + b\u2032] in \u2124\u2099.\n\nAction: We draw the conclusion that the combined difference is a multiple of n.  \nReasoning: A linear combination of integers remains an integer, so (k + \u2113) \u2208 \u2124.  \nResult: We have proven that the sum of any two representatives gives the same equivalence class.  \nCorrectness: This final inference follows from the standard definition of congruences.\n\n**Dead Ends Considered:**  \nWe briefly considered proving well-definedness by choosing canonical representatives between 0 and n \u2212 1, but we found that this approach still relies on the same divisibility argument under the hood and does not simplify the logical structure of the proof.  We also considered a proof by contradiction, but that route proved more cumbersome than the direct method.\n\n**Self-Verification:**  \nWe check that each sentence begins with a word and ends with a period.  We verify that every symbol (for example, k, \u2113, n) was introduced and explained before use.  We confirm that we consistently used first person plural and active voice.  We inspect each logical step to ensure that no hidden appeals to unproven facts appear.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nWe have shown that whenever [a] = [a\u2032] and [b] = [b\u2032] in \u2124\u2099, then [a + b] = [a\u2032 + b\u2032].  Consequently, addition in \u2124\u2099 is well-defined because the result depends only on the congruence classes and not on the particular representatives.", "confidence": null, "confidence_breakdown": {"answer_confidence": null, "reasoning_confidence": null, "assumptions_confidence": null}, "alternative_answers": [], "reasoning_tokens": 659, "answer_tokens": 3, "total_thinking_time_ms": 0}}}

We then invoke the Cantor\u2010Bernstein\u2010Schr\u00f6der theorem to conclude that |A| = |B|.\n\nStep 1: Construct an injection f\u2009:\u2009A \u2192 B.  \nAction:  We define the function f by the rule  \n\u2003\u2003f(x) = (2\u2009x + 1)\u2009/\u20094  \nfor each real number x in A.  \nReasoning:  We choose a linear map that sends the left endpoint 0 of A to 1/4 and sends values near 1 (but less than 1) to values near 3/4.  This guarantees that no image value reaches 0 or 1.  \nResult:  The rule f(x) = (2\u2009x + 1)\u2009/\u20094 defines a function from A into B.  \nCorrectness:  \n\u2003\u2022  For each x in A we have 0 \u2264 x < 1, so 0 \u2264 2\u2009x < 2 and thus 1 \u2264 2\u2009x + 1 < 3.  Dividing by 4 yields 1/4 \u2264 f(x) < 3/4.  Therefore f(x) is strictly between 0 and 1, which shows that f(x) \u2208 B.  \n\u2003\u2022  If f(x\u2081) = f(x\u2082) for x\u2081, x\u2082 in A then (2\u2009x\u2081 + 1)/4 = (2\u2009x\u2082 + 1)/4.  Multiplying both sides by 4 gives 2\u2009x\u2081 + 1 = 2\u2009x\u2082 + 1 and subtracting 1 yields 2\u2009x\u2081 = 2\u2009x\u2082 so x\u2081 = x\u2082.

For each ordered pair (x,y) in \u211d\u00b2 we set  \n\u2003u = \u03c6(x) = 0.a\u2081 a\u2082 a\u2083 \u2026,  \n\u2003v = \u03c6(y) = 0.b\u2081 b\u2082 b\u2083 \u2026,  \nwhere each a\u1d62 and b\u1d62 is a digit in {0,1,\u2026,9} and neither expansion ends with a tail of nines.  We then interleave these digits to form a new number in (0,1) by  \n\u2003w = 0.a\u2081 b\u2081 a\u2082 b\u2082 a\u2083 b\u2083 \u2026.  \nFinally we define f(x,y) to be w viewed as a real number in \u211d.  \n\nReasoning:  \nWe need an injection from \u211d\u00b2 into \u211d in order to apply the Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schr\u00f6der theorem.  The interleaving of decimal digits ensures that distinct pairs (x,y) produce distinct interleaved sequences, so that f is one-to-one.\n\nResult:  \nThe function f : \u211d\u00b2 \u2192 \u211d defined by f(x,y) = interleaving(\u03c6(x),\u03c6(y)) is an injection.\n\nCorrectness:  \nWe verify that f is well-defined because each real number in (0,1) has a unique non\u2013nine\u2010ending decimal expansion.  We verify that f is one-to-one by observing that if f(x,y) = f(x\u2032,y\u2032) then the decimal expansion of the common image recovers the sequence (a\u2081,b\u2081,a\u2082,b\u2082,\u2026) and thus recovers \u03c6(x), \u03c6(y), \u03c6(x\u2032), and \u03c6(y\u2032).  Since \u03c6 is bijective, we conclude that x = x\u2032 and y = y\u2032.\n\nStep 2: Construction of an injection from \u211d to \u211d\u00b2.  \nAction:  \nWe define g : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\u00b2 by the rule  \n\u2003g(t) = (t,0).  \n\nReasoning:  \nWe need an injection from \u211d into \u211d\u00b2 in order to apply the Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schr\u00f6der theorem.  The mapping t \u21a6 (t,0) is evidently one-to-one because two ordered pairs are equal exactly when their first coordinates are equal.\n\nResult:  \nThe function g defined by g(t) = (t,0) is an injection from \u211d into \u211d\u00b2.\n\nCorrectness:  \nWe verify that if g(t) = g(t\u2032) then (t,0) = (t\u2032,0) and therefore t = t\u2032.\n\nVerification:  \nWe have constructed injections f : \u211d\u00b2 \u2192 \u211d and g : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\u00b2.  The Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schr\u00f6der theorem asserts that whenever there are injections from set A to set B and from B to A, then there exists a bijection between A and B.  In our context, A = \u211d\u00b2 and B = \u211d, so the theorem applies directly to f and g.\n\nConclusion:  \nBy the Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schr\u00f6der theorem, there exists a bijection between \u211d\u00b2 and \u211d.  Hence the cardinalities of \u211d\u00b2 and \u211d coincide, and we conclude that |\u211d\u00b2| = |\u211d|.", "confidence": null, "confidence_breakdown": {"answer_confidence": null, "reasoning_confidence": null, "assumptions_confidence": null}, "alternative_answers": [], "reasoning_tokens": 526, "answer_tokens": 0, "total_thinking_time_ms": 0}}}

We define f to be the identity map on A with codomain B so that for each element x in A we set f of x equals x. Because each element of A is sent to a unique element of B, the mapping f is injective.  \nAction: Define f : A \u2192 B by f(x) = x.  \nReasoning: We require an injection from A into B to fulfill the hypotheses of the Cantor-Bernstein-Schr\u00f6der theorem.  \nResult: The function f is injective.  \nCorrectness: The identity mapping on a subset is manifestly one-to-one.\n\nStep 2: Apply the Cantor-Bernstein-Schr\u00f6der theorem to f and g.  \nWe recall that the Cantor-Bernstein-Schr\u00f6der theorem asserts that whenever there is an injection from one set X into another set Y and an injection from Y into X, then there exists a bijection between X and Y. We have already constructed f as an injection from A into B and we are given g as an injection from B into A. We invoke the theorem to conclude that there is a bijection h from A onto B. Consequently, we deduce that A and B have the same cardinality.  \nAction: Invoke Cantor-Bernstein-Schr\u00f6der on the injections f and g.  \nReasoning: Existence of injections in both directions guarantees a bijection.  \nResult: There exists a bijective function h : A \u2192 B.  \nCorrectness: This conclusion follows directly from the Cantor-Bernstein-Schr\u00f6der theorem.\n\nDead Ends Considered:  \nWe first attempted to build an explicit bijection by alternating images under f and g. That construction became unwieldy and risked ambiguity in partitioning the domain. We also contemplated an argument based solely on finite versus infinite cases, but we recognized that the Cantor-Bernstein-Schr\u00f6der theorem provides a uniform and complete resolution.\n\nSelf-Verification:  \nWe have verified that each sentence begins with a word and ends with a period. We have confirmed that no sentence starts with a mathematical symbol and that injections and bijections are clearly explained. We have used the first person plural and active voice consistently. We have ensured that each step contains an Action, Reasoning, Result, and Correctness. The logical flow from hypotheses to conclusion is sound.\n\nFinal Answer:  \nSince A is included in B and since there exists an injection from B into A, the Cantor-Bernstein-Schr\u00f6der theorem guarantees a bijection between A and B.

We denote by AB, BC, and CA the three sides of the triangle.  We wish to prove that the three perpendicular bisectors of these sides meet at a single point, called the circumcenter of triangle ABC.\n\nGiven Information:\nWe are given a triangle with vertices A, B, and C.  \nWe denote by AB the segment joining A and B, by BC the segment joining B and C, and by CA the segment joining C and A.  \nWe assume that A, B, and C are not collinear.\n\nTo Prove:\nWe aim to show that the perpendicular bisector of AB, the perpendicular bisector of BC, and the perpendicular bisector of CA are concurrent at a single point O.\n\nStep 1: Construct the perpendicular bisector of segment AB\nAction: We construct point D as the midpoint of segment AB and draw line l1 through D that is perpendicular to AB.  \nReasoning: We require a locus of points equidistant from A and B so that any point on l1 satisfies distance to A equals distance to B.  \nResult: Line l1 is the perpendicular bisector of AB, and thus every point on l1 is equidistant from A and B.  \nCorrectness: This follows from the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem which states that the perpendicular bisector of a segment consists of all points equidistant from the segment\u2019s endpoints.\n\nStep 2: Construct the perpendicular bisector of segment BC\nAction: We construct point E as the midpoint of segment BC and draw line l2 through E that is perpendicular to BC.  \nReasoning: We require a second locus of points equidistant from B and C so that any point on l2 satisfies distance to B equals distance to C.  \nResult: Line l2 is the perpendicular bisector of BC, and thus every point on l2 is equidistant from B and C.  \nCorrectness: This follows likewise from the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem applied to segment BC.\n\nStep 3: Show that l1 and l2 intersect at a unique point O\nAction: We observe that lines AB and BC are not parallel, so their perpendicular lines l1 and l2 cannot be parallel.  \nReasoning: Since AB and BC meet at vertex B inside the plane, the perpendiculars to those lines must also intersect because two distinct nonparallel lines in the plane have exactly one intersection point.  \nResult: Lines l1 and l2 meet at a unique point O.  \nCorrectness: This follows from Euclid\u2019s parallel postulate or from basic incidence properties of Euclidean lines.\n\nStep 4: Demonstrate that O is equidistant from A, B, and C\nAction: We note that O lies on l1 and therefore OA equals OB.  We also note that O lies on l2 and therefore OB equals OC.  \nReasoning: A point on the perpendicular bisector of a segment is equidistant from the endpoints of that segment.  \nResult: We obtain OA = OB and OB = OC, hence OA = OC.  \nCorrectness: This conclusion follows from the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem for both segments AB and BC.\n\nStep 5: Conclude that O lies on the perpendicular bisector of AC\nAction: We observe that O satisfies OA = OC, so O belongs to the locus of points equidistant from A and C.  \nReasoning: The locus of points equidistant from A and C is exactly the perpendicular bisector of AC.  \nResult: Point O lies on the perpendicular bisector of AC.  \nCorrectness: This follows from the Converse of the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem.\n\nConstruction Details:\nWe have constructed points D and E as the midpoints of AB and BC respectively.  \nWe have drawn line l1 perpendicular to AB at D and line l2 perpendicular to BC at E.  \nWe have defined O as the unique intersection of lines l1 and l2.\n\nKey Geometric Principles Used:\n1. Perpendicular Bisector Theorem.  \n2. Converse of the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem.  \n3. Incidence and parallelism properties of Euclidean lines.  \n4. Basic distance equality properties in Euclidean geometry.\n\nDead Ends Considered:\nWe initially considered using an analytic coordinate approach by assigning coordinates to A, B, and C, but we found the classical Euclidean construction more direct and conceptually clearer.  \nWe also contemplated constructing the perpendicular bisector of AC first, but that approach is symmetric and leads to the same concurrency argument.\n\nVerification:\nWe verify that each step follows logically from the previous one and that no step assumes the result prematurely.  \nWe confirm at Step 4 that O\u2019s equal distances to A, B, and C ensure uniqueness of the circumcenter.  \nWe check that the use of the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem is appropriate for each segment.\n\nConclusion:\nWe have proven that the perpendicular bisectors of sides AB, BC, and CA in triangle ABC are concurrent at a unique point O.  This point O is equidistant from vertices A, B, and C and thus serves as the center of the circle passing through A, B, and C, known as the circumcircle of triangle ABC.", "confidence": null, "confidence_breakdown": {"answer_confidence": null, "reasoning_confidence": null, "assumptions_confidence": null}, "alternative_answers": ["Alternative proof methods available using different geometric approaches"], "reasoning_tokens": 815, "answer_tokens": 4, "total_thinking_time_ms": 0, "geometric_constructions": [], "geometric_principles": []}}}

Points A, B, and C are noncollinear and form triangle A B C.  \n2. Line l passes through point A and is parallel to side B C.\n\n**To Prove:**  \nThe measure of angle A B C plus the measure of angle B C A plus the measure of angle C A B equals 180 degrees.\n\n**Step 1: Construct line l through A parallel to B C**  \nAction: We draw line l through point A so that line l is parallel to line segment B C.  \nReasoning: We wish to apply the alternate interior angle theorem and the corresponding angle theorem. A parallel through A will create transversals with lines A B and A C.  \nResult: Line l is parallel to side B C by construction.  \nCorrectness: We invoke the parallel postulate of Euclid to assert existence and uniqueness of line l through A parallel to B C.\n\n**Step 2: Identify corresponding and alternate interior angles**  \nAction: We label the intersection of line l with the line through A and B as point D and with the line through A and C as point E.  \nReasoning: By constructing points D and E we form transversals A B and A C with the parallel lines l and B C. This will let us identify equal angle measures.  \nResult: Angle D A B is formed by line l and line A B. Angle A B C is formed by line A B and side B C. Angle E A C is formed by line l and line A C. Angle A C B is formed by line A C and side B C.  \nCorrectness: Existence of intersections D and E follows from noncollinearity of A, B, C and infinite extent of lines.\n\n**Step 3: Relate those angles by parallel line theorems**  \nAction: We assert that angle D A B equals angle A C B and that angle E A C equals angle A B C.  \nReasoning: Because line l is parallel to B C, line A B is a transversal and therefore the corresponding angle at A, which is angle D A B, equals the corresponding angle at C, which is angle A C B. Similarly, line A C is a transversal and the alternate interior angle at A, which is angle E A C, equals the alternate interior angle at B, which is angle A B C.  \nResult: We obtain that angle D A B equals angle A C B and that angle E A C equals angle A B C.  \nCorrectness: We apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate and the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, both of which are valid under Euclidean parallel line axioms.\n\n**Step 4: Sum the three angles at vertex A and equate to a straight angle**  \nAction: We note that angle D A B plus angle C A B plus angle B A E forms a linear pair on line l, thus summing to 180 degrees.  \nReasoning: Points D, A, and E are collinear by definition of line l, so the angle from ray A D through ray A E is a straight angle of measure 180 degrees. We substitute the equal measures found in Step 3 for angles D A B and E A C.  \nResult: We obtain the equation (angle A C B) plus (angle C A B) plus (angle A B C) equals 180 degrees.  \nCorrectness: We use the fact that a straight angle measures 180 degrees and we previously established the equalities of the corresponding and alternate interior angles.\n\n**Construction Details:**  \n\u2022 Line l is drawn through point A parallel to side B C.  \n\u2022 Point D is defined as the intersection of line l with line A B.  \n\u2022 Point E is defined as the intersection of line l with line A C.\n\n**Key Geometric Principles Used:**  \n\u2022 Euclid\u2019s Parallel Postulate for the existence of a unique parallel line.  \n\u2022 Corresponding Angles Postulate for parallel lines and transversal.  \n\u2022 Alternate Interior Angles Theorem for parallel lines and transversal.  \n\u2022 Linear Pair Postulate that two adjacent angles on a straight line sum to 180 degrees.\n\n**Dead Ends Considered:**  \nWe initially attempted to prove the angle sum by subdivision into two triangles plus area arguments.

Side BC has length a.  \n3. Side AC has length b.  \n4. Side AB has length c.\n\n**To Prove:**  \nWe intend to demonstrate that a squared plus b squared equals c squared.\n\n**Step 1: Construct the altitude from C to AB**  \nAction: We draw the line segment CD perpendicular to AB, with D on AB.  \nReasoning: We require an altitude from the right\u2013angle vertex to the hypotenuse in order to create smaller similar triangles.  \nResult: Point D lies on AB and CD is perpendicular to AB.  \nCorrectness: We applied the Euclidean postulate that through a point not on a line there passes exactly one perpendicular to that line.\n\n**Step 2: Establish similarity of triangles ABC, ACD, and CBD**  \nAction: We compare angles in triangles ABC, ACD, and CBD.  \nReasoning: We observe that \u2220ACB equals 90 degrees by hypothesis, and we constructed CD so that \u2220CDB also equals 90 degrees.  We also note that \u2220CAB is common to triangles ABC and ACD, and that \u2220CBA is common to triangles ABC and CBD.  \nResult: Triangle ACD is similar to triangle ABC by angle\u2013angle criterion.  Triangle CBD is also similar to triangle ABC by angle\u2013angle criterion.  \nCorrectness: We used the AA similarity criterion which states that two triangles are similar if two pairs of corresponding angles are congruent.\n\n**Step 3: Write proportional relationships from similarity**  \nAction: We extract side ratios from the similarity of triangle ACD to triangle ABC.  \nReasoning: The similarity of triangles ACD and ABC yields the equation AC over AB equals AD over AC.  \nResult: We obtain b divided by c equals AD divided by b.  \nCorrectness: We applied the proportionality of corresponding sides in similar triangles.\n\n**Step 4: Solve for b squared**  \nAction: We multiply both sides of b divided by c equals AD divided by b by b times c.  \nReasoning: We isolate b squared to express it in terms of c and AD.  \nResult: We obtain b squared equals c times AD.  \nCorrectness: We used elementary algebraic manipulation preserving equality.\n\n**Step 5: Write proportional relationship for the other small triangle**  \nAction: We extract side ratios from the similarity of triangle CBD to triangle ABC.  \nReasoning: The similarity of triangles CBD and ABC yields the equation BC over AB equals DB over BC.  \nResult: We obtain a divided by c equals DB divided by a.  \nCorrectness: We again used the proportionality of corresponding sides in similar triangles.\n\n**Step 6: Solve for a squared**  \nAction: We multiply both sides of a divided by c equals DB divided by a by a times c.  \nReasoning: We isolate a squared to express it in terms of c and DB.  \nResult: We obtain a squared equals c times DB.  \nCorrectness: We used consistent algebraic steps preserving equality.\n\n**Step 7: Sum the expressions for a squared and b squared**  \nAction: We add the equations b squared equals c times AD and a squared equals c times DB.  \nReasoning: We combine the contributions of the two legs to relate them to c.  \nResult: We obtain a squared plus b squared equals c times (AD plus DB).  \nCorrectness: We used the distributive property of multiplication over addition.\n\n**Step 8: Recognize that AD plus DB equals AB**  \nAction: We note that points A, D, and B are collinear in that order.  \nReasoning: By construction D lies on AB, so the segment AD plus segment DB constitutes AB.  \nResult: We substitute AD plus DB with AB to obtain a squared plus b squared equals c times c.  \nCorrectness: We used the segment addition postulate.\n\n**Step 9: Conclude the Pythagorean relation**  \nAction: We simplify c times c to c squared.  \nReasoning: By definition of square we have c times c equals c squared.  \nResult: We derive a squared plus b squared equals c squared.  \nCorrectness: We applied the definition of a square of a real length.\n\n**Construction Details:**  \nWe constructed altitude CD from vertex C perpendicular to hypotenuse AB such that D lies on AB.
